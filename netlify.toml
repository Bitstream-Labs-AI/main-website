# QR Code redirects for contact vCards
# These redirects provide stable URLs for QR codes that point to contact information.
# The subdomain qrcode-redirect.bitstreamlabs.ai must be configured in Netlify
# as a domain alias for these redirects to work.
#
# Temporarily redirecting to main site until vCard URLs are finalized.
# Using 302 (temporary) redirects until final URLs are confirmed.
# Once final vCard URLs are determined, update these redirects and consider upgrading to 301 (permanent) redirects.
